# MLBAnalysis

I did an analysis over the 2023 MLB Season. I Wanted to see what a lineup of the best OBP at each position would look like.

This was an interesting project with some interesting finds. Including over half the lineup being able to hit left handed. 

One thing to note, in the data some players that play multiple outfield positions are marked as OF, so the lineup technically has 10 players to accomodate for that.
